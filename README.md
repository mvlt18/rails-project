# Rails Project: Social Grads

 ![college](public/images/victoria-heath-b7CRDcwfNFU-unsplash.jpg)

 For the project, I created a web application called **Social Grads** - a social tool for graduate school submissions. This app was inspired by the forum section of [The Student Doctor Network](https://forums.studentdoctor.net) - if you have never been to this site, it's AMAZING.

When I was applying to grad school myself, I spent **MANY** hours reading anything and everything I could on this site. Two of my favorite (and super popular) forums are "The All-Encompassing, "What are my chances" thread!" and "Applied, Interviewed, Rejected, Attending" - the latter is truly what inspired me to create Social Grads. I know the pain of scrolling down to read every last post hoping to find any information on who is applying to what school, what their background is, and most importantly, did they get in?

Social Grads takes this forum and creates a tool where users can create an account and add their information to a user profile. Users can sign up for a new account or login via GutHub.

Once logged in, they can add submissions for each program they are applying to as show below:

Not only is this an easy way to keep track of all the programs you are applying to, you can also easily search the site for other users - look at their profiles, see the submissions they have created and even look at college profiles with a summary of all the submissions by the Social Grads community who have active submissions at that school.
